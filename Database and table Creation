Create Database: Creates a new database called pizzhut.

Select Database: Switches to the pizzhut database.

Retrieve Data: Attempts to fetch all records from the orders table (assumes it exists).

Create Orders Table: Defines an orders table with order_id, order_date, and order_time, with order_id as the primary key.

Create Order Details Table: Defines an order_details table with order_details_id, order_id, pizza_id, and quantity, with order_details_id as the primary key.

This setup involves creating and using a database, defining tables for orders and order details, and specifying primary keys for data integrity.


create database pizzhut;
use pizzahut;
select * from pizzhut.orders;
create table orders(
order_id int not null, 
order_date date not null,
order_time time not null,
primary key(order_id));

Create table order_details(
order_details_id int not null, 
order_id int not null, 
pizza_id text not null,
quantity int not null,
primary key(order_details_id))
